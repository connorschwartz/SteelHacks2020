Based on the game Free-Fall, Falling Through Space is a game where two players try to survive for as long as possible by falling through the gaps to avoid hitting the top of the screen. Once a player collides with the top of the screen, their game is over. Whichever player has the most points after both players collide with the top of the screen will be declared the winner of the match.

The controls are <A,D> to move the block left and right. There will also be occasional powerup blocks that will slow down the scrolling speed temporarily for a player which is useful as the player progresses farther. The block's scrolling will become faster as the time increases.

Players can play by going to https://falling-through-space.appspot.com/ and entering the same room number to allow two players to play against each other over a network connection.
